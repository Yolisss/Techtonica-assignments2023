      <h3>What is Wonton Soup?</h3>
      <div class="paragraph">
      Wonton soup is a standard of Chinese cuisine and made from seasoned
      chicken broth with filled wontons. Wontons are an Asian equivalent of
      ravioli or tortellini when they are folded around a spiced meat mixture.
      This recipe usually calls for ground pork as the foundation for the
      filling because it has great flavor and a meaty texture. Other meats or
      proteins could be substituted, such as shrimp, ground chicken or turkey,
      or even ground beef. But in our case, we'll make it vegetarian friendly!
