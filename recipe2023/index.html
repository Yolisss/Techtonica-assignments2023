  <h4>What is Wonton Soup?</h4>
  <div>
    Wonton soup is a standard of Chinese cuisine and made from seasoned chicken
    broth with filled wontons. Wontons are an Asian equivalent of ravioli or
    tortellini when they are folded around a spiced meat mixture. This recipe
    usually calls for ground pork as the foundation for the filling because it
    has great flavor and a meaty texture. Other meats or proteins could be
    substituted, such as shrimp, ground chicken or turkey, or even ground beef.
    But in our case, we'll make it vegetarian friendly!
